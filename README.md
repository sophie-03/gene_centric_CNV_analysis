# gene_centric_CNV_analysis

This repo contains the scripts used to generate the results presented in "A gene-centric analysis of copy number variation reveals tumour suppressor modulation of cancer risk and novel associations with common diseases".  

The repo is seperated into sections reflecting the stages of analysis in the study, each section has it's own README.

For a reproducible pipeline to carry out your own genome wide association test between CNVs overlapping genes and a phenotype, see ```Reproducible_pipeline``` directory.

If you have any questions about this code please reach out to me: s.matthews5@universityofgalway.ie
